## Requirements ##

 dhunter requires [Python](http://www.python.org/) interpreter installd in your system in
 version 3.6 or newer.

## Virtual environment ##

 I suggest to install `dhunter` in virtual environment.  This is neither mandatory,
 nor required, nor even recommended, but doing that would help keeping all the
 dependencies isolated from other python packages or tools you may have installed
 which let you avoid, sometimes unsolvable dependency conflicts.
 
 If you are unfamiliar with virtual environments please see tons of tutorials on-line,
 like [Python Virtual Environments in Five Minutes](https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/).
 
## Installation ##

 Use `pip` package manager to install `dhunter` on your machine (if you are using
 virtual env, do not forget to activate it prior installation):
 
    pip install dhunter

 If you want it install for current user only add `--user` flag:

    pip install dhunter --user

 Once installed you should have `dscan` and `dhunt` available.
